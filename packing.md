## List

 + Directory of where each item is in the car!
  - Just make a sheet and keep it in the glovebox so you can find these key items easily if you need to.
 + Shovel
 + Winch!
 + Camper top
 + A GOOD tire pump
 + Tire repair kit
 + Rear diff locker?
 + 2 Orange Safety Cones (road triangles) (police check for these at stops in some countries)
 + Fire Extinguisher -- must have valid check sticker (police check for these at stops in some countries)
 + Reflective tape on the vehicle bumpers/body (red in rear, white in front)
 + Tow Chain (to solicit help if you break down-- there will be no tow truck! Also is mandatory in Nicaragua)
 + First Aid Kit

 + You may want to bring spare air, oil and gas filters for your car in case you cannot find any that fit your car on your trip. You should also have spare belts and extra fuses with you. ''edit dare2go'': If your car has any electronics (most models released after 1990 will have some) take the most vital sensors for your model!
 + Tamper Proof License plates
 + Tinted Windows (already have this!)
 + White Sheet (really, just a white sheet, like one for wrapping bodies.  You need one in Argentina!)


## Tips

 - Other than the necessary electronics, don’t bring valuables with you. Expensive jewelry could attract thieves who are experts at targeting tourists. If you do bring valuables, always travel with them in your carry-on, and keep them locked up in the hotel safe.
 - Before you leave, empty your wallet of unnecessary items, such as credit cards that you don’t plan to use on your trip.
 - If you wear prescription glasses, pack an extra pair.
 - Use closed baggage tags to label each bag. Put your name, address and phone number both inside and outside your luggage.
 - Buy Transportation Security Administration approved locks, and always keep your luggage locked. Check to see if you can send your locked bags on in-country flights; TSA locks may not be recognized and could be cut to inspect your bags. Never put valuables in your checked luggage, and check carefully after going through security to ensure that all of your valuables are still in your carry-on.
 - Electrical outlets are different all over the world, so you’ll need to have adapters that allow your devices to plug into foreign sockets. Your best bet is to buy an adapter with different settings that adjust to most outlets, so you only have to worry about one adapter instead of one per country. You also need to check the strength of the electrical current wherever you’re going and make sure your devices are compatible—cell phones and computers often are. If you have a device that’s not compatible with a higher or lower current, then you’ll need to buy a transformer or leave that gadget at home. Finally, if you don’t own them already, it’s worth investing in portable phone chargers and/or spare batteries that can be charged and swapped into phones, cameras, and other electronics so that you can stay fully charged while you’re on the go.
