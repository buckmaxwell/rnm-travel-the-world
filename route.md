## Our Route

In order to be as safe as possible we have planned the following route, keeping in mind that the USA Mexico Border is to be treated with caution regardless of which state is being traveled.

The border includes

	- Baja California
	- Chihuahua - defer non essential travel to some places
	- Coahuila - defer non essential travel
	- Nuevo Leon
	- Tamaulipas - defer non essential travel
	- Sonara - defer non essential travel to some places

Of these, Nuevo Leon is currently the safest state, with the suggested crossing being Laredo-Colombia Solidarity International Bridge. 

Here is a safety map for Mexico circa 2015:

### Colombia

Tens of thousands of U.S. citizens safely visit Colombia each year for tourism, business, university studies, and volunteer work.  Security in Colombia has improved significantly in recent years, including in tourist and business travel destinations such as Bogota, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Medellin, and Cali.  However, violence linked to narco-trafficking continues to affect some rural and urban areas. Despite significant decreases in overall crime in Colombia, continued vigilance is warranted due to an increase in recent months of violent crime, including crime resulting in the deaths of American citizens.

## Government Alerts/Warnings


- U.S. government personnel and their families are prohibited from personal travel to all areas to which the Department recommends “defer non-essential travel” 

- As a result of security precautions that U.S. government personnel must take while traveling to parts of Mexico, our response time to emergencies involving U.S. citizens may be hampered or delayed. 

-  The Mexican government dedicates substantial resources to protect visitors to major tourist destinations and has engaged in an extensive effort to counter criminal organizations that engage in narcotics trafficking and other unlawful activities throughout Mexico. There is no evidence that criminal organizations have targeted U.S. citizens based on their nationality. Resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the level of drug-related violence and crime that are reported in the border region or in areas along major trafficking routes.

- U.S. government personnel are prohibited from patronizing casinos, sports books, or other gambling establishments in the states of Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosi, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Jalisco, Colima and Nayarit.

- U.S. citizens have been murdered in carjacking and highway robberies, most frequently at night and on isolated roads. Carjackers use a variety of techniques, including roadblocks, bumping/moving vehicles to force them to stop, and running vehicles off the road at high speeds.

- There are indications that criminals target newer and larger vehicles, but drivers of old sedans and buses coming from the United States are also targeted.

- U.S. government personnel are prohibited from intercity travel after dark in many areas of Mexico. U.S.

- The Mexican government has deployed federal police and military personnel throughout the country as part of its efforts to combat organized criminal groups. U.S. citizens traveling on Mexican roads and highways by car or bus may encounter government checkpoints, staffed by military or law enforcement personnel. In some places, criminal organizations have erected their own unauthorized checkpoints, at times wearing police and military uniforms, and have killed or abducted motorists who have failed to stop at them. You should cooperate at all checkpoints.

-  Travelers should be mindful that even if no advisories are in effect for a given state, U.S. citizens should exercise caution throughout Mexico as crime and violence can still occur.


- Intercity travel at night is prohibited for U.S. government personnel.
