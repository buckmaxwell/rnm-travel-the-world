# Phones & Communication


This section details how we plan to stay in communication regardless of where we are.


You can buy cheap phones in Central and South America, the best price comes from the company Movistar. The phone will cost around $30 USD which includes 300 minutes, and refill your account at any Movistar location or at many convenience stores. Calling USA or Canada costs about $1 USD per half hour. Another option is to use a computer and Skype to call. Calls to the US are $.02 USD a minute. If your family and friends have basic computer knowledge, have them install Skype themselves - Skype-to-Skype calls are free, and the connection seems to be even better than calling a regular phone. You can also find Skype at internet cafes.
