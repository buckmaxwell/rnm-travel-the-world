# South America here we come!

I want to travel from Cleveland, OH USA to the tip of South America in a car with my girlfriend.  We plan to cross the 90 mile Darien Gap by shipping our car, and flying or boating ourselves to Columbia.  From there we will just keep going.


## The Car

Here is a breakdown of possible cars.  They are categorized by their biggest sacrifice.

#### Breaks down often
 + Jeep Cherokee XJ (1987 – 2001)
 + Ford Ranger XLT (1998 – 2011)
 + Isuzu Trooper (1991 – 2002)

#### Limited off road
 + Subaru Outback (1994 – Present) -- lots of availability. 3-4k for < 200,000 miles
 + Toyota Tacoma (1995 – 2004) -- lots of availabilty.  ~6k for < 200,000 miles* 
 + Toyota 4Runner (1995 – 2009) -- good availability, cheaper than Taco.  ~4k for < 200,000 miles*

*The Tacoma and 4Runner can be made into true offroad vehicles by adding a locking rear differential for ~2.5k

#### Terrible Gas Milage
 + Toyota Land Cruiser (1980 – 1997) -- limited availability and high price
 + Chevy Silverado (1999-2006) -- John uses this Silverado for off-roading.  Expensive when under 200,000 miles.

#### ???
 + Mercedes-Benz Sprinter
 + Jeep Wranger -- poor handling on pavement, pricey, breaks down often

## A Tacoma or a 4Runner


After the evaluation it seems the Toyata Tacoma (1995 – 2004) or the Toyota 4Runner (1996-2002) is the vehicle I need. 

### Tacoma

![2001 Taco](http://www.cstatic-images.com/stock/900x600/225414.jpg)
It is true part time 4WD. reliable, and rugged as hell. This set of years marks the first generation.  
 - 4WD models can be seen by the 6 Stud wheel lug pattern, rather than the 5 stud pattern in the 2WD models. 
 - Three engine sizes are available
 	+ 2.4 L four-cylinder rated at 142 hp (106 kW) and 160 lb·ft (217 N·m) of torque
 	+ 2.7 L four-cylinder rated at 150 hp (112 kW) and 177 lb·ft (240 N·m) of torque
 	+ 3.4 L V6 rated at 190 hp (142 kW) and 220 lb·ft (298 N·m) of torque.
 - '97+ has a passenger side airbag
 - 2000+ has Toyota's Automatic Differential Disconnect (ADD)
 - In 2008, Toyota proactively announced a 15-year, unlimited mileage corrosion warranty for 1995-2000 model years due to inadequate rustproofing and frame corrosion issues affecting over 800,000 Tacomas. Toyota will either repair the frame or buyback the truck for 1.5 times its KBB retail value. This was later extended to include 2001-2004 model years.
 - 99.5 to 00 were bought back and crushed if they had a rusted out frame. My 99 fell under this catagory. 01 to 04 are having the rusted out frames replaced.
 - On November 21, 2012, Toyota recalled about 150,000 Tacoma mid-size pickup trucks from the model years 2001 to 2004 that were sold primarily in 20 cold-weather U.S. states. The recall involves the spare tire and how it could fall off.
 - cabs
 	+ crew cab (4 door)
 	+ extracab / extended cab (2 door)
 	+ regular cab (2 door)
 - Toyota issued a recall on the lower ball joint due to the possibility of premature wear from improper finishing in production. The ball joints will be replaced under the recall. This recall applies to 2001-2004 models only. Please contact you local Toyota dealer to see if your vehicle is included.
 - What about after market air lockers? $2500 for a rear ARB locker with onboard air

### 4Runner

Fill stuff in.



### About 4WD/AWD/RWD

 - 4 wheel drive is 2 wheel drive in reality.
 - 2 wheel drive (rwd) is 1 wheel drive in reality.
 - 4 wheel drive with a locker front or rear is actually 3 wheel drive.
 - 4 wheel drive with a locker in the front and rear is the true definaition of 4 wheel drive.
