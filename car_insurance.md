## Colombia

SOAT insurance required.  

Foreign registered vehicles may be brought into Colombia temporarily for tourism or transit.

The vehicle owner must obtain a permit before they can drive the car in the country. In some cases these permits are issued at the border, and include the immediate purchase of the SOAT (compulsory car insurance).  The car owner must fill in a Temporary Vehicle Import Form (Formulario de importación temporal de vehiculos). However, at some borders it is the driver’s responsibility to go to the nearest Customs Office to obtain the permit.

In all cases the following documents need to be provided along with the Temporary Vehicle Import Form:

Copy of the vehicle registration documents
Copies of the passport pages with photo and Colombian entry stamp
Bill of lading or shipping document (if applicable)
It is advisable to contact the Ministry of Transport for the latest requirements before bringing a car or motorbike into Colombia temporarily:
