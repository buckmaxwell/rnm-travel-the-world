TIP: 

You will also need copious amounts of photocopies of all of the required documents every time you cross a border. These can be simply organized by placing multiple copies of each document in a clear sheet protector and collecting these in a binder. That way all copies are organized and you can quickly find the document you need. Store the originals somewhere very safe, and only use them when necessary. It also is a good idea to electronically scan all original documents, and email yourself and a couple of friends or family these electronic copies. That way if there is some catastrophe and you lose all originals and copies, you will be able to access the copies online.  Check out the information on a specific country for exact document requirements.
