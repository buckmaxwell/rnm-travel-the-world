TIP: 

### Have Copies
You will also need copious amounts of photocopies of all of the required documents every time you cross a border. These can be simply organized by placing multiple copies of each document in a clear sheet protector and collecting these in a binder. That way all copies are organized and you can quickly find the document you need. Store the originals somewhere very safe, and only use them when necessary. It also is a good idea to electronically scan all original documents, and email yourself and a couple of friends or family these electronic copies. That way if there is some catastrophe and you lose all originals and copies, you will be able to access the copies online.  Check out the information on a specific country for exact document requirements. 


### Don't hand over original documents
If you get stopped by a police officer, only hand over photocopies of your documents. This may seem unusual, but if the police officer is expecting a bribe, the only way he can get it from you is if you have something to loose. If you don't hand him any important documents, there is nothing he can do. I would expect that if you did this in Canada or the United States, you may find yourself stuffed and cuffed quickly. However, if an officer is looking for a bribe, he is not going to bring you to the police station, as he has less of a chance getting a bribe from you there. In fact, many tourist police in Mexico will have “tourists pay no fines” written on the police cars in Spanish. In Guatemala, documents are considered personal properly, and it is illegal for an officer to take them. If an officer insists on seeing your original documents, insist that you will follow him to the local police station and present them there. An exception to this rule is police officers at border crossings and the Mexican military checkpoints. The military checkpoints in Mexico may be look more intimidating than a lone police officer but are very professional and courteous.
