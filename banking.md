This section provides useful info and advice on banking information and advice.


## Bring 2 credit cards

Choose one or two credit cards to take with you, and call the issuers shortly before you leave to inform them of which countries you will be visiting. Otherwise, your credit card could be denied, as the issuer may find the international activity suspicious.


## Use ATMs

Traveler’s checks are no longer universally accepted, and you may have trouble using them in many countries, especially the less developed ones. Instead, use your bank card to withdraw money from ATMs, which can be found in even the most exotic destinations. Memorize your numeric PIN, as many ATM keypads will not display the numbers and letters we use, or they may be placed differently on the keypad. Generally, your most favorable exchange rate will be through the ATM, although most companies will charge a transaction fee.

## Memorize, or write down your credit card numbers

Write down your credit card numbers, but don’t keep the list in your wallet. Know how to contact your company from abroad. Toll-free numbers do not work from outside the U.S., but credit card companies will accept collect calls at a designated number.


## Buy Travel Insurance


It is likely that your health insurance won’t cover you while you’re traveling abroad. Depending on where you’re going, consider buying medical evacuation and emergency medical insurance. Also, if your trip requires a large down payment or is booked many months in advance, trip interruption and cancellation insurance can provide valuable protection from the unexpected.
