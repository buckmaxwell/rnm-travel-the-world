# Food ideas 

* Rice & beans! canned, instant, dry
* Dried fruit
* Nuts
* Fresh Fruit will only last a day or two (obviously) but good to note that carrots last longer without refridgeration
* Freeze-dried/dehydrated foods pricey, but good for those nights when you need convenience
* Spices (pepper, garlic powder or salt, basil, cayenne pepper, lemon pepper, cumin, crushed red pepper, cinnamon) for flavor
* Plenty of energy/granola/fig bars
* Ramen noodles
* dry pasta
* Instant stuffing
* Instant potatos
* Tuna
* Jerky
* Powdered milk?

# Tips

* Check the cook time for foods such as pasta, potatoes, rice, quinoa, etc. and make sure to plan for enough fuel (some of these dishes take a deceptively long time to cook).
* Rather than take a prolonged break for a midday meal (involving unpacking, preparation, cleanup and repacking), a quicker strategy is to graze on a series of modest energy-boosting snacks throughout the day.
  * Popular choices: Jerky, dried fruit, fig bars, energy bars and nuts.

 * I plan on bringing a reusable cup with me along with a box or two of tampons for those moments when I can't clean the cup properly.
